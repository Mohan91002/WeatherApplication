# Project Workflow — Jira ↔ Git

How this project is run like a real delivery: **Jira issues drive short-lived
git branches**, which merge to `main` via pull request, which triggers deploy.

This doc adds the **issue → branch → PR** linkage. For the mechanics of
branching, testing, PRs and deploys, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Jira project

- **Project key:** `WEA` (WeatherApplication)
- **Backlog:** [jira-backlog.csv](jira-backlog.csv) —
  import via *Jira → System → External System Import → CSV*, mapping
  `Epic Link` (Story→Epic), `Parent Id` (Sub-task→Story) and `Sprint`.
- **Hierarchy:** **6 Epics → 27 Stories → 78 Sub-tasks**, plus **5 Spikes**;
  ~18 Bugs are raised as found. **116 issues pre-created (~134 with bugs).**
- Delivered across **4 two-week sprints** — see [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md) §4.

| Epic key | Epic | Stories |
| -------- | ---- | :-----: |
| WEA-1 | Backend API foundation | 5 |
| WEA-2 | Currency & founding-year data | 4 |
| WEA-3 | Frontend UI & interactive map | 8 |
| WEA-4 | Testing & QA | 3 |
| WEA-5 | DevOps & AWS deployment | 5 |
| WEA-6 | Project management & UX | 2 |

## Issue lifecycle (how a ticket becomes code)

1. **To Do → In Progress.** Pick a story, e.g. `WEA-113 Station-model region card`.
2. **Branch** off `main`, named after the key:
   `git switch -c feature/WEA-113-station-card`
3. **Commit** with the key in the subject so Jira links the work automatically:
   `git commit -m "WEA-113: add station-model card layout"`
4. **Pull request** against `main`; CI runs the backend + frontend tests on the PR.
5. **Review → squash-merge**, delete the branch; Jira moves the story to **Done**.
6. **Deploy.** Landing on `main` builds/pushes the API image and publishes the SPA
   (deploys never run from a PR) — see [cloud/DEPLOY.md](cloud/DEPLOY.md).

Sub-tasks are usually separate commits on the story's branch; a large story may
use one branch per sub-task. Bugs use `fix/WEA-<id>-<slug>`, spikes use
`spike/WEA-<id>-<slug>`.

---

## Branch naming

`feature/WEA-<id>-<slug>` (stories) · `fix/WEA-<id>-<slug>` (bugs) ·
`spike/WEA-<id>-<slug>` (spikes). Prefixes match [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

> **Note:** the branches below are created to mirror the backlog structure.
> Because the app is already delivered on `main`, each starts level with `main`;
> in a live project each would instead carry that story's commits before merging.
